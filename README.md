# hello-world

Greetings! This is my first ever time working with GitHub, and so far I am quite excited!

My first ever language was Actionscript 3, and as of now I've primarily studied/worked around with Python 3 for around three months and counting. My current short-term goals so far consist of learning C#/.NET, in addition to HTMI/CSS within three months. (As of May 5th, 2016).
